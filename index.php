        <p>MS Paint IDE is a program that can read a normal image file saved with MS Paint, and can then translate it to
            text with the ability to highlight the text in the image, parse the code, compile and execute it. It
            provides a clean and simple interface, with your actual programming in a program you and millions of others
            already know how to use, and already have. MS Paint IDE allows the use of external libraries, multiple
            classes, and much much more.</p>
